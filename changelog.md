  In the my.cnf file a user can specify credentials for different databases and
  invoke mycli with the group name to use the appropriate credentials.
  eg:
  ```
  # my.cnf
  [client]
  user   = 'root'
  socket = '/tmp/mysql.sock'
  pager = 'less -RXSF'
  database = 'account'

  [clientamjith]
  user     = 'amjith'
  database  = 'user_management'

  $ mycli --defaults-group-suffix=amjith   # uses the [clientamjith] section in my.cnf
  ```

* Add `--defaults-file` option to the command line. This allows specifying a
  `my.cnf` to use at launch. This also makes it play nice with mysql sandbox.

  a drop in replacement for mysql.
