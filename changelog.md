1.4.0:
======

  eg: 
  ```
  mycli> source filename.sql
  ```

* Added a config option to make the warning before destructive commands optional. (Thanks: [Daniel West](https://github.com/danieljwest))

  In the config file ~/.myclirc set `destructive_warning = False` which will
  disable the warning before running `DROP` commands.

  still preliminary and it will be enhanced in the future.

1.3.0:
======

Features:
---------
* Add a new special command (\T) to change the table format on the fly. (Thanks: [Jonathan Bruno](https://github.com/brewneaux))
  eg: 
  ```
  mycli> \T tsv
  ```
* Add `--defaults-group-suffix` to the command line. This lets the user specify
  a group to use in the my.cnf files. (Thanks: [Iryna Cherniavska](http://github.com/j-bennet))

  In the my.cnf file a user can specify credentials for different databases and
  invoke mycli with the group name to use the appropriate credentials.
  eg:
  ```
  # my.cnf
  [client]
  user   = 'root'
  socket = '/tmp/mysql.sock'
  pager = 'less -RXSF'
  database = 'account'

  [clientamjith]
  user     = 'amjith'
  database  = 'user_management'
  
  $ mycli --defaults-group-suffix=amjith   # uses the [clientamjith] section in my.cnf
  ```

* Add `--defaults-file` option to the command line. This allows specifying a
  `my.cnf` to use at launch. This also makes it play nice with mysql sandbox.

* Make `-p` and `--password` take the password in commandline. This makes mycli
  a drop in replacement for mysql. 

1.2.0:
======

Features:
---------

* Add support for wider completion menus in the config file.

  Add `wider_completion_menu = True` in the config file (~/.myclirc) to enable this feature.

* Prevent Ctrl-C from quitting mycli while the pager is active. 
* Refresh auto-completions after the database is changed via a CONNECT command.
