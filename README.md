Features
--------

`mycli` is written using [prompt_toolkit](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit/).

* Auto-completion as you type for SQL keywords as well as tables, views and
  columns in the database.
* Syntax highlighting using Pygments.
* Smart-completion (enabled by default) will suggest context-sensitive completion.
    - `SELECT * FROM <tab>` will only show table names.
    - `SELECT * FROM users WHERE <tab>` will only show column names.
* Support for multiline queries.
* Favorite queries. Save a query using `\fs alias query` and execute it with `\f alias` whenever you need.
* Timing of sql statments and table rendering.
* Config file is automatically created at ``~/.myclirc`` at first launch.
* Log every query and its results to a file (disabled by default).
* Pretty prints tabular data.
* Support for SSL connections

Contributions:
--------------

If you're interested in contributing to this project, first of all I would like
to extend my heartfelt gratitude. I've written a small doc to describe how to
get this running in a development setup.

## Detailed Install Instructions:

### Fedora

Fedora has a package available for mycli, install it using dnf:

```
$ sudo dnf install mycli
```

### RHEL, Centos

I haven't built an RPM package for mycli for RHEL or Centos yet. So please use `pip` to install `mycli`. You can install pip on your system using:

```
$ sudo yum install python-pip
```

Once that is installed, you can install mycli as follows:

```
$ sudo pip install mycli
```

### Thanks:

This project was funded through kickstarter. My thanks to the [backers](http://mycli.net/sponsors) who supported the project.

A special thanks to [Jonathan Slenders](https://twitter.com/jonathan_s) for
creating [Python Prompt Toolkit](http://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit),
which is quite literally the backbone library, that made this app possible.
Jonathan has also provided valuable feedback and support during the development
of this app.

[Click](http://click.pocoo.org/3/) is used for command line option parsing
and printing error messages.

Thanks to [PyMysql](https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL) for a pure python adapter to MySQL database.

[terminaltables](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/terminaltables) is used for
pretty printing the query results.


### Compatibility

Tests have been run on OS X and Linux.

THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED IN WINDOWS, but the libraries used in this app are Windows compatible. This means it should work without any modifications. If you're unable to run it on Windows, please file a bug. I will try my best to fix it.

### Use with pager (mysql workaround)
As described [here](https://github.com/dbcli/mycli/issues/281), " we only read the [client] section of my.cnf not the [mysql] section".

So, if you want to use a pager, your .my.cnf file should looks like this:

```
[mysql]
pager  = mypager
[client]
pager  = mypager
```

instead of just this :

```
[mysql]
pager  = mypager
```
